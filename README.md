## What is walking skeleton?

> A "walking skeleton" is an implementation of the thinnest possible slice of real functionality that we can automatically build, deploy, and test end-to-end.

A "Walking Skeleton" is the minimal implementation of a real feature that we can automatically build, deploy, and end-to-end test. You should choose an actual product feature, and the smaller it is, the better â€“ it should be simple but genuine. In the process of completing this feature, we need to:

1. Establish a rough architecture and make the most basic technical decisions to create the walking skeleton.
2. Write an end-to-end test to automate the testing of this feature.
3. Set up an automatic CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline with the following stages:
4. Build
5. End-To-End Test
6. Deploy
